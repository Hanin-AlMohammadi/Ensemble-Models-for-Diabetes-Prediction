# Ensemble-Models-for-Diabetes-Prediction
This project explores various machine learning algorithms and ensemble techniques to predict the presence of diabetes based on a set of medical features. The dataset includes information such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin levels, and other health metrics. 
The project covers:

. Data Preprocessing: Scaling and cleaning the data to prepare it for model training.

. Feature Selection: Using different models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and SVM to select the most important features.

. Model Training: Building and evaluating several models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, and ensemble methods like Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Voting.

. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy and classification reports.
